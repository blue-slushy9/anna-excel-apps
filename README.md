This is a little Python script I got from Bing AI, just had to make a few changes to get it to do what I needed. It extracted information from a long Excel spreadsheet and deleted duplicate entries before outputting to a text file, which is a lot more readable than the spreadsheet.

anna_excel_apps.py was used to extract the information from the Excel spreadsheet.

anna_apps_list.py was used to organize the resulting text file to make it more organized and legible.
